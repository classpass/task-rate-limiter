# Overview

[Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) is a platform for stateful stream computation for the JVM,
and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) is a popular JVM language. This project tries to make using Flink with Kotlin more
delightful with helpers that allow using idiomatic Kotlin patterns with Flink's Java API.
